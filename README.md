This project aims to develop a WhatsApp clone, replicating the core functionalities of the popular messaging application.  
The clone will focus on providing users with the ability to exchange text messages, images, and videos in real-time.  
Key features will include user registration and authentication, contact management, one-on-one and group chat capabilities, 
status updates, and push notifications.  The project will explore the challenges of building a scalable and reliable real-time communication system, 
including efficient data handling, network optimization, and security considerations.  The development process will involve selecting appropriate 
technologies for the backend (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django, or similar) and frontend (e.g., React Native, Flutter, or native mobile development) 
and implementing robust communication protocols (e.g., WebSockets).  This project serves as a practical exercise in understanding the architecture
and implementation details of a modern messaging platform.
